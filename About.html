<p class="story">
My name is liya Adugna came from Ethiopia. I went to Elizabeth Andrew high school and then I attended Gordon State College.
After 2 years I moved to Clayton state university studied Bachelor of Health Care Administration and graduated December 2018.
I heard about Rafcode class on Facebook and decided to join the class even
I do not have any coding class experience before.
I learn from this class about html, css and how to develop website in html.
Also I am very excited to start taking this course and developing my first website.
Unfortunately, I am still learning more things about css and JavaScript.
